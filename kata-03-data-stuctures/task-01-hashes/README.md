# Task 1: Work with Redis Hashes

## Objective

Learn to manipulate Redis hash data structures using commands like `HSET`, `HGET`, `HDEL`, and `HGETALL`.

## Steps

1. Use `HSET` to set field-value pairs in a hash.
2. Use `HGET` to retrieve the value of a specific field in a hash.
3. Use `HDEL` to remove a field-value pair from a hash.
4. Use `HGETALL` to retrieve all fields and values from a hash.

## Validation

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to run the validation script.
