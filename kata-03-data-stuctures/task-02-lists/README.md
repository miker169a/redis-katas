# Task 2: Advanced List Operations

## Objective

Learn advanced Redis list operations like `LRANGE`, `LINSERT`, `LSET`, and `LTRIM`.

## Steps

1. Use `LRANGE` to retrieve a sub-list from a list.
2. Use `LINSERT` to insert an element at a specific position.
3. Use `LSET` to change the value of an element by its index.
4. Use `LTRIM` to keep only a sub-range and remove others.

## Validation

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to run the validation script.
