# Task 2: Advanced SET Operations

## Objective

Learn advanced Redis set operations like `SISMEMBER`, `SINTER`, `SUNION`, and `SDIFF`.

## Steps

1. Use `SADD` to create multiple sets for operation (set1, set2, set3).
2. Use `SISMEMBER` to check for the existence of a member in a set.
3. Use `SINTER` to find the intersection between multiple sets.
4. Use `SUNION` to find the union of multiple sets.
5. Use `SDIFF` to find the difference between multiple sets.

## Validation

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to run the validation script.
